Stewbot is a Python IRC script which accepts commands and performs utility
operations related to steward or administrator tasks. It has grown rather
organically from a single-file script based on pywikipedia into an independent
modularized framework, so there are still issues with tight coupling and messy
code.

To configure stewbot, rename stewardbot/__config__.example.py to
stewardbot/__config__.py and change the values therein. (TODO: create a
default-config/user-config scheme.)
